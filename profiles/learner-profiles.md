## Software developers and hobbyist AI enthusiasts

### Background 

Background in computer science and programming. They are familiar with Python and have experience with machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, they are new to generative AI and want to explore its possibilities and applications.

### Motivation

Motivated by the desire to learn how to deploy generative AI models locally on their laptop or workstation without relying on cloud services. They are interested in exploring the capabilities of LLaMA C++, LlamaFile, Ollama, Open WebUI, and Jupyter AI but lack practical experience with these tools.

### Expected level of expertise

Novice to competent practitioner. They should have a solid foundation in programming concepts, but their experience with generative AI is expected to be limited.

### Goals and objectives

* Understand the benefits of local deployment for generative AI models
* Learn how to set up and use LLaMA C++, LlamaFile, Ollama, Open WebUI, and Jupyter AI
* Gain hands-on experience with these tools to develop a deeper understanding of their capabilities and limitations

### Preferred learning style

They prefer interactive lessons with practical exercises and code examples. They appreciate step-by-step instructions and clear explanations of complex concepts.
